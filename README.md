# WebScraping_UOL
 
## About

This project was made in my free time, to train some Python skills (like lists, loops, requests..) and to contribute to something big. 

This project is not the end, but the mean to bigger projects that involve AI training, because we can extract data from internet (and metadata too), that is everywhere and it can be used for several fields of Data Science. We can do some analysis through the metadata, for example.
